## Agile Development Pass Cloud Platform

Alinous-Core is an application server to run Domain Specific Language(DSL) as agile developemnt framework. It can execute SQL directly in the programming language.

## No framework makes programming easy and agile
Web Database development framework is complex and it is difficult to learn it. By suppoting the framework functions by DSL, It is very easy to learn it.

## Simple and Agile Programming with Eclipse IDE
Simple program code is good for programmers to maintain it. This programming language provides Eclipse IDE so that following functions are available.

- Edit code with content assist
- Debugging program with debugger

# Example Application
This framework has an example web database application, which is [Content Management System for Documentation Sites](https://www.alinous.org/document-cms/).

The source code of the CMS is hosted on Github, [docker-alinous-cms](https://github.com/alinous-core/docker-alinous-cms).

# Extend functions by Java Code
The Application Server is written in Java, therefore it can be exteded by putting jar files (Java archive file) on the proper dorectory.
The application server will automatically detect them and automatically deploy it internally.

## Near future of Alinous-Core
