Eclipse Plugin IDE to develop and debug is available.\r\n\r\n![Web Database Programming](https://github.com/alinous-core/alinous-agile-base/blob/master/pgimage.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Alinous-Core Official Site](https://wwww.alinous.org)\r\n\r\n[Github Page](https://alinous-core.github.io/alinous-agile-base/)\r\n\r\n## Agile Development Pass Cloud Platform\r\n\r\nAlinous-Core is an application server to run Domain Specific Language(DSL) as agile developemnt framework. It can execute SQL directly in the programming language.\r\n\r\n## Programming Language as Framework makes programming easy and agile\r\nWeb Database development framework is complex and it is difficult to learn it. By suppoting the framework functions by DSL, It is very easy to learn it.\r\n\r\n## Agile Devops tools\r\nDevops needs simple programming code. Simple code without complex framework is easy to maintain.\r\nWhen you change the specification of the application or website, you can do it very easily.\r\n\r\n## Simple and Agile Programming with Eclipse IDE\r\nSimple program code is good for programmers to maintain it. This programming language provides Eclipse IDE so that following functions are available.\r\n\r\n- Edit code with content assist\r\n- Debugging program with debugger\r\n\r\n## Example CMS Application\r\n\r\n![Web Database Programming](https://github.com/alinous-core/alinous-agile-base/blob/master/cmsimage.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThis framework has an example web database application, which is [Content Management System for Documentation Sites](https://www.alinous.org/document-cms/).\r\n\r\nThe source code of the CMS is hosted on Github, [docker-alinous-cms](https://github.com/alinous-core/docker-alinous-cms).\r\n\r\n## Extend functions by Java Code\r\nThe Application Server is written in Java, therefore it can be exteded by putting jar files (Java archive file) on the proper dorectory.\r\nThe application server will automatically detect them and automatically deploy it internally.\r\n\r\n## Download Built Software\r\nYou can download built Server Side Program and Eclipse SDK from following pages.\r\n\r\n - [Download Page](https://www.alinous.org/documents/downloads/)\r\n\r\nThe Example CMS is included in the Eclipse Plugin SDK as a CMS Project.\r\n\r\n## Software License\r\nThis software's License is MIT License.\r\n\r\n## Near future of Alinous-Core\r\nNow we are developong C++ version of this language. It contains original high performance database. It will comming soon.\r\n\r\n[Alinous-Core Official Blog](https://wwww.alinous.org/blog/)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
