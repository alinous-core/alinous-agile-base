In this directory are two examples that illustrate the use of JavaCC
generated parsers to collect input from a GUI and process it
appropriately.  The example used is a simple calculator.  There are
two versions of this example:

. A version that uses a JavaCC parser without the JavaCC token manager
  in directory ParserVersion.

. A version that uses a JavaCC token manager without the JavaCC parser
  in directory TokenMgrVersion.  This example also illustrates the
  ability to build a state machine as a lexical specification.

The README files in these directories provide more details.
