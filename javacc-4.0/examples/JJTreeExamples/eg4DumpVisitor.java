/* This is an example of how the Visitor pattern might be used to
   implement the dumping code that comes with SimpleNode.  It's a bit
   long-winded, but it does illustrate a couple of the main points.

   1) the visitor can maintain state between the nodes that it visits
   (for example the current indentation level).

   2) if you don't implement a jjtAccept() method for a subclass of
   SimpleNode, then SimpleNode's acceptor will get called.

   3) the utility method childrenAccept() can be useful when
   implementing preorder or postorder tree walks.
