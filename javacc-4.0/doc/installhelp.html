<H1>JavaCC [tm]: Installation Notes</H1>


<P>The download should have placed into your file system either a ZIP
or GZIP file containing the JavaCC software.</P>

<P>Depending on which you downloaded, you should go to the directory
where the file was installed and type something like:</P>

<blockquote>
<code>unzip javacc-3.2.zip</code> <p>
<P>
<B>or</b>
<P>
<code>gunzip javacc-3.2.tar.gz</code> <br>
<code>tar xvf javacc-3.2.tar</code> <p>
</blockquote>
<P>
That completes your installation.</P>
<P>
Once you have completed installation, add the <code>bin</code> directory
within the JavaCC installation to your path.
The <code>javacc</code>,
<code>jjtree</code>, and <code>jjdoc</code> invocation scripts/executables
reside in this directory.</P>
<P>
You can get started quickly by looking at the examples and the associated
README files in the <code>examples</code> directory under the installation
directory.  For additional information consult the 
<a href="docindex.html">documentation index</a> and the following release notes:
<ul>

<li><a href="jjtreereleasenotes.html">JJTree release notes</a></li>
<li><a href="jjdocreleasenotes.html">JJDoc release notes</a></li>
</ul>
Additional help is available on the JavaCC
