<hr>

<p>
There are many ways to write the lexical specification for a grammar. But 
the performance of the generated token manager varies significantly depending
on how you do this.  Here are a few tips:

</p><ul>

<li> Try to specify as many String literals as possible. These are recognized
   by a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), which is much faster than the Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) needed to recognize other kinds
   of complex regular expressions. For example, to skip blanks/tabs/newlines,
<pre>   
    SKIP : { " " | "\t" | "\n" }
</pre>
   is more efficient than doing 

<pre>    SKIP : { &lt; ([" ", "\t", "\n"])+ &gt; }
</pre>

   because in the first case you only have string literals, it will generate
   a DFA whereas for the second case it will generate an NFA.
<p>

</p></li><li> Try to use the pattern ~[] just by itself as much as possible. For example,
   doing a 

<pre>      MORE : { &lt; ~[] &gt; }
</pre>

   is better than doing

<pre>      TOKEN : { &lt; (~[])+ &gt; }
</pre>

   of course, if your grammar dictates that one of these cannot be used, then
   you don't have a choice, but try to use &lt; ~[] &gt; as much as possible.
<p>

</p></li><li> Specify all the String literals in the order of increasing length, i.e.,
   all shorter string literals before longer ones. This will help optimizing
   the bit vectors needed for string literals.
<p>

</p></li><li> Try to minimize the use of lexical states. When using these, try to move
   all your complex regular expressions into a single lexical state, leaving
   others to just recognize simple string literals.
<p>

</p></li><li> Try to use IGNORE_CASE judiciously. Best thing to do is to set this option
   at the grammar level. If that is not possible, then try to have it set for 
   *all* regular expressions in a lexical state. There is heavy performance
   penalty for setting IGNORE_CASE for some regular expressions and not for others in the
   same lexical state.
<p>

</p></li><li> Try to SKIP as much possible, if you don't care about certain patterns.
   Here, you have to be a bit careful about EOF. seeing an EOF after SKIP
   is fine whereas, seeing an EOF after a MORE is a lexical error.
<p>

</p></li><li> Try to avoid specifying lexical actions with MORE specifications. Generally
   every MORE should end up in a TOKEN (or SPECIAL_TOKEN) finally so you can
   do the action there at the TOKEN level, if it is possible.
<p>

</p></li><li> Also try to avoid lexical actions and lexical state changes with SKIP
   specifications (especially for single character SKIP's like " ", "\t",
   "\n" etc.). For such cases, a simple loop is generated to eat up the
   SKIP'ed single characters. So obviously, if there is a lexical action
   or state change associated with this, it is not possible to it this way.
<p>

</p></li><li>Try to avoid having a choice of String literals for the same token, e.g.
<pre> 
      &lt; NONE : "\"none\"" | "\'none\'" &gt;
</pre> 
   
   Instead, have two different token kinds for this and use a nonterminal which
   is a choice between those choices. The above example can be written as :
                                      
<pre> 
        &lt; NONE1 : "\"none\"" &gt;             
      |  
        &lt; NONE2 : "\'none'\" &gt;             
</pre> 
                                      
   and define a nonterminal called None() as :
                                      
<pre> 
      void None() : {} { &lt;NONE1&gt; | &lt;NONE2&gt; }
</pre> 
 
   This will make recognition much faster. Note however, that if the choice is
   between two complex regular expressions, it is OK to have the choice.
