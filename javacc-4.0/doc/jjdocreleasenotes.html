=========
JJDoc 0.1
=========

JJDoc takes a JavaCC parser specification and produces documentation
for the BNF grammar.  It can operate in three modes, determined by
command line options.

    TEXT                   (default false)

Setting TEXT to true causes JJDoc to generate a plain text format
description of the BNF.  Some formatting is done via tab characters,
but the intention is to leave it as plain as possible.

The default value of TEXT causes JJDoc to generate a hyperlinked HTML
document.

    ONE_TABLE              (default true)

The default value of ONE_TABLE is used to generate a single HTML table
for the BNF.  Setting it to false will produce one table for every
production in the grammar.

    OUTPUT_FILE

The default behavior is to put the JJDoc output into a file with
either .html or .txt added as a suffix to the input file's base name.
You can supply a different file name with this option.
